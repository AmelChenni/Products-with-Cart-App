# 🛒 Products Cart Application

## 📌 Description
A simple e-commerce application built with **JavaScript, HTML, and CSS**.  
It fetches products from a JSON file, displays them with categories, and allows users to add/remove items from a cart. The cart data is saved in **LocalStorage**, so it remains even after page reloads.
